# Alternup - Manage your alternship

![Image Description](docs/readme_cover.jpg)  

Welcome to **Alternup**, a NuxtJS solution allowing tutors to monitor and manage their work-study students (and interns). The project now relies on a Supabase database, Tailwind CSS as a styling framework and TypeScript. The application will allow you to see your work-study students/trainees, see your tasks, see your average, your skills and create personalized quizzes.

docker run -p 3000:3000 alternup-frontend
```

```bash
docker build -t alternup-backend ./apps/backend
docker run -p 4000:4000 alternup-backend
```

# Manual - with commands
